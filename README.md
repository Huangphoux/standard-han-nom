# Create Anki decks for learning the standard chữ Hán Nôm

## Description
For this project, I aimed to create the Anki decks that helps learning the standard Han Nom characters. The deck are organized by grade levels ranging from grade 1 to grade 5, with THCS-and-beyond level be denoted as grade 6. The source list was taken from https://www.hannom-rcv.org/.

The notebook generates 6+6 = 12 separated decks, which I later merged into 2 decks using Anki (by manually importing six decks and then exporting them as one).

Notes:
1. The Han Nom characters in the brackets are the simplipied version (giản thể)
2. The uppercase Quoc-ngu letters are the standard Sino-Vietnamese (Hán Việt) sounds of Chinese characters; lowercase ones are the reading of the Nom character or the non-standard Sino-Vietnamese sounds of the Chinese character.
