# Create Anki decks for learning the standard chữ Hán Nôm

## Overview
- Seeks to improve votaquangnhat's generated Anki decks.
- The source list is from https://www.hannom-rcv.org/.

Notes:
1. Characters in brackets are the simplified version (giản thể)
2. Uppercase means standard Sino-Vietnamese (Hán Việt) readings of Chinese characters; lowercase means the reading of the Nom character or the non-standard Sino-Vietnamese sounds of the Chinese character.

## Notable improvements
- Cards' ordering based on order of apperance in the adjusted grading sheet ([Link to the Google Sheets]()).
    - This is *huge*, because the old decks don't consider the order of apperance in the old grading list.
- Nicer card formatting.
    - Supported fonts embedding in the deck by default (Minh Nguyen for the front, Gothic Nguyen for the back).
- Notes and grading infos in Anki notes and card's formatting.
    - Grade 7: Characters in the level 2 list.
    - Grade 8: Characters not included in either list.
- Added Audio and Picture fields.
    - Allow adding audios (i.e. generating using HyperTTS)
    - Allow adding pictures to better illustrate the meaning of the character
